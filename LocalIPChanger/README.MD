# # # # # # # # # #

  I created this program because I wanted to find a way to mess with my school's IT department. We know that they watch our class, 
so I thought a great way to mess with them would to be dropping IPs and picking another one up every 10 seconds. I don't know if 
they have noticed, because I'm not really there to see their faces, but while working on it, I found out it is a great program to 
run on a raspberry pi or some other infiltration device to change the IP a less common rate to lower suspicion, but the changing IP 
address keeps them from being able to watch the device intently.
